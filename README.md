# 🃏 Crazy 8 — Unity C# Scripts

This repository contains the C# scripts used in a Unity-based **Uno-style card game** called Crazy 8. 
This version uses the rules that Dad taught us growing up, and the aim of this passion project is to make a complete version of the game to recreate that same amazingly fun experience.
